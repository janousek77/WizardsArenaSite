      <h2>Ben</h2>
        <p>At the moment, I'm just finishing up my fourth year as a student at the University of
          Washington Bothell. For this project, I made the art for the spell icons, the HP bar,
          and the lightning spell projectile. I also added all of the sound effects found in the
          game (courtesy of FreeSound.org) and worked on revising quite a bit of the code.

      <h2>Camden</h2>
		<p>I am finishing my third year at UWB and I am a CSSE major. For the game portion of the
		  project, I made the pause menu and the borders of the arena as well as tweaking many of
		  our scripts. I tried working on sprites and a new aiming script, neither of which worked
          out. I also recorded and edited our video, took screenshots, and gathered our final
		  playtest results.

      <h2>Chris</h2>
      <p>I'm currently a junior at the University of Washington Bothell. On this
        project I worked heavily on the main character's behavior, spells,
        potions, and finding/fixing bugs.
